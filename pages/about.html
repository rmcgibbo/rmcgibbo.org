<p> I am currently a research scientist at D.E. Shaw Research, where I work on
    the development of more accurate physics-based models for molecular dynamics
    simulations.</p>

<p> Previously, I did my Ph.D. in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University,
    where I worked with <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main">Vijay Pande</a> at
    the intersection of <b>biophysics</b> and <b>machine learning</b> on
    quantitative statistical analysis of protein dynamics via long-timescale
    molecular simulation and the development of parsimonious statistical models of
    these statistical data. My Ph.D. thesis is available
    <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11614108">here</a>.
    Beforehand, I was an undergraduate from Princeton University, where I studied
    Chemistry and Computer Science. While there, I worked with
    <a href="http://webscript.princeton.edu/~abbgroup/about_andy">Andrew Bocarsly</a>.</p>

<p> In my free time, I read, follow politics, and rock climb. You can contact

<h2 class="entry-title">Research</h2>
<p> My research at Stanford with <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main">Vijay Pande</a>
    centered around building new techniques for the quantitative statistical
    analysis of long timescale molecular dynamics simulations, typically for
    protein folding and conformational change.</p>
<p> This work has involved both theory, software development, and applications.
    Aspects have involved distance metric learning, using large-margin
    techniques, the development of novel L1-regularized hidden Markov models
    for analysis of protein dynamics (including a massively accelerated
    multicore and CUDA implementations), and variational methods for model
    selection. </p>
<p> Most of this research requires writing new software, and
    scalability is a central priority for our work on massive protein dynamics
    datasets. This work is all publicly available on <a href="http://github.com/rmcgibbo">github</a>. </p>
