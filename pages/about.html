  <p> I'm currently a fourth year PhD student in
      the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University. I work with
      <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main">Vijay Pande</a> at
      the intersection of <b>biophysics</b> and <b>machine learning</b> on
      quantitative statistical analysis of protein dynamics via long-timescale
      physics-based simulation and Markov models.</p>
  <p>I graduated from Princeton University, where I studied Chemistry and
      Computer Science. While there, I worked with
      <a href="http://webscript.princeton.edu/~abbgroup/about_andy">Andrew Bocarsly</a>.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I read, follow politics, and rock climb. You can contact
     me at <img height=18px style="position: relative; top: 4.5px;" src="static/rmcgibbo.png"/></span>

<h2 class="entry-title">Research</h2>
<p> My research at Stanford with <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main">Vijay Pande</a>
    centers around building new techniques for the quantitative statistical
    analysis of long timescale molecular dynamics simulations, typically for
    protein folding and conformational change.</p>
<p> This work has involved both theory, software development, and applications.
    Aspects have involved distance metric learning, using large-margin
    techniques, the development of novel L1-regularized hidden Markov models
    for analysis of protein dynamics (including a massively accelerated
    multicore and CUDA implementations), and variational methods for model
    selection. </p>
<p> Most of this research requires writing new software, and
    scalability is a central priority for our work on massive protein dynamics
    datasets. This work is all publicly available on <a href="http://github.com/rmcgibbo">github</a>. </p>
