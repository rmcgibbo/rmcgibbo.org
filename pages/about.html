<h2 class="entry-title">Robert T. McGibbon</h2>

<p> I am currently employed as a researcher at <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/">Hudson River Trading</a>,
    where I develop machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to improve automated trading strategies.
</p>

<p> From 2016 to 2025, I worked in the force field group at <a hhref="https://www.deshawresearch.com/">D.E. Shaw Research</a>.
    While there, I built machine learning and physics-based potentials for molecular dynamics
    simulations of prospective drugs and the biological targets they interact with.</p>

<p> I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford University (2016),
    where I worked with <a href="https://a16z.com/author/vijay-pande">Vijay Pande</a> on
    long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and time series analysis.
    My thesis is available <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11614108">here</a>.
    I earned my bachelor's degree at Princeton University (2011), where I studied
    Chemistry and Computer Science and worked with
    <a href="https://bocarsly.princeton.edu/andrew-bocarsly">Andrew Bocarsly</a>.</p>

<p> In my free time, I read, rock climb, and contribute to open source software. You can contact

<!-- <h2 class="entry-title">Ph.D. Research</h2>
<p> My research at Stanford with the <a href="https://www.pandelab.org/about">Folding@Home team</a>
    centered around building new techniques for the quantitative statistical
    analysis of long timescale molecular dynamics simulations, typically for
    protein folding and conformational change.</p>
<p> This work involved both theory, software development, and applications.
    Aspects have involved distance metric learning, using large-margin
    techniques, the development of novel L1-regularized hidden Markov models
    for analysis of protein dynamics (including a massively accelerated
    multicore and CUDA implementations), and variational methods for model
    selection. See my <a href="/publications">publications</a> for more
    information.</p>
<p> Most of this research required writing new software, and
    scalability is a central priority for our work on massive protein dynamics
    datasets. This work is all publicly available on <a href="http://github.com/rmcgibbo">github</a>. </p> -->
