<p> I am currently a research scientist in the force field group at D.E. Shaw Research, where I work on
    the development of more accurate physics-based models for molecular dynamics
    simulations.</p>

<p> I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford University (2016),
    where I worked with <a href="https://a16z.com/author/vijay-pande">Vijay Pande</a> at
    the intersection of <b>biophysics</b> and <b>machine learning</b> on
    quantitative statistical analysis of protein dynamics via long-timescale
    molecular simulation and the development of parsimonious statistical models of
    these statistical data. My thesis is available
    <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11614108">here</a>.
    I earned my bachelors at Princeton University (2011), where I studied
    Chemistry and Computer Science. While there, I worked with
    <a href="http://webscript.princeton.edu/~abbgroup/about_andy">Andrew Bocarsly</a>.</p>

<p> In my free time, I read, follow politics, and rock climb. You can contact

<h2 class="entry-title">Ph.D. Research</h2>
<p> My research at Stanford with the <a href="https://www.pandelab.org/about">Folding@Home team</a>
    centered around building new techniques for the quantitative statistical
    analysis of long timescale molecular dynamics simulations, typically for
    protein folding and conformational change.</p>
<p> This work involved both theory, software development, and applications.
    Aspects have involved distance metric learning, using large-margin
    techniques, the development of novel L1-regularized hidden Markov models
    for analysis of protein dynamics (including a massively accelerated
    multicore and CUDA implementations), and variational methods for model
    selection. See my <a href="/publications">publications</a> for more
    information.</p>
<p> Most of this research required writing new software, and
    scalability is a central priority for our work on massive protein dynamics
    datasets. This work is all publicly available on <a href="http://github.com/rmcgibbo">github</a>. </p>
