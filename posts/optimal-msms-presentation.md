Title: Optimal Markov Models: Formulation & Pursuit

Tags: talks, MSMs, tICA, theory, cross validation, protein dynamics

I spoke this afternoon about our recent work [[on arXiv][1]] on the
parameterization and cross-validation of Markovian models of molecular
kinetics. The talk focus on the theory for a variational formulation
of low-rank approximations to the kinetics of reversible dynamical systems.
